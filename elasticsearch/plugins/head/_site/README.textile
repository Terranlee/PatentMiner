There are two main ways of running and installing elasticsearch-head

h4. Running as a plugin of Elasticsearch

* @sudo elasticsearch/bin/plugin -install mobz/elasticsearch-head@
* @open http://localhost:9200/_plugin/head/@

This will automatically download the latest version of elasticsearch-head from github and run it as a plugin within the elasticsearch cluster. In this mode;
* elasticsearch-head automatically connects to the node that is running it
* If you've installed the .deb package, then the plugin exectuable will be available at /usr/share/elasticsearch/bin/plugin.

h4. Running with built in server

* enable "cors":http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/modules-http.html by add @http.cors.enabled: true@ in elasticsearch configuration
* @git clone git://github.com/mobz/elasticsearch-head.git@
* @cd elasticsearch-head@
* @npm install@
* @grunt server@
* @open@ "http://localhost:9100/":http://localhost:9100/

This will start a local webserver running on port 9100 serving elasticsearch-head
* Best option if you are likely to connect to serveral different clusters

h4. Alternatives

h5. Running from the filesystem

elastisearch-head is a standalone webapp written in good-ol' html5. This means, you can put it up on any webserver, run it directly from the filesystem, use it on an ipad, or put it on a floppy disk and carry it with you.

h4. URL Parameters

Parameters may be appended to the url set some initial state eg. @head/index.html?base_uri=http://node-01.example.com:9200@

* @base_uri@ force elasticsearch-head to connect to a particular node.
* @dashboard@ experimental feature to open elasticsearch-head in a mode suitable for dashboard / radiator. Accepts one parameter @dashboard=cluster@ 
* @auth_user@ adds basic auth credentials to http requests ( requires "elasticsearch-http-basic":https://github.com/karussell/elasticsearch-http-basic plugin or a reverse proxy )
* @auth_password@ basic auth password as above (note: without "additional security layers":http://security.stackexchange.com/questions/988/is-basic-auth-secure-if-done-over-https, passwords are sent over the network *in the clear* )

# (to run jasmine tests) "phantomjs":http://phantomjs.org

Then

# create a fork of elasticsearch-head on github
